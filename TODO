TODO list
=========
- add binary and hex output formats [input now done]
- unify/combine all conversions into single function convert()
- improve graphs in GUI (zooming, etc.)
- GUI : arrow up should bring up last result - use http://library.gnome.org/devel/gtk/unstable/GtkWidget.html#GtkWidget-key-press-event (?)
- grab/import -- have a central repository to download functions from (?)
- save() -- have a central file (on user's computer) that HC will load automatically every start; save() would save a user-defined function/variable to that file
- sleep()
