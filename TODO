TODO list
=========
- add binary and hex output formats [input now done]
- improve graphs in GUI (zooming, etc.)
- grab/import -- have a central repository to download functions from (?)
- save() -- have a central file (on user's computer) that HC will load automatically every start; save() would save a user-defined function/variable to that file
